# Workshop 1
CodersLab Workshop 1
The task is to compose a 'Tasks' program, that will keep a list of user's to do list.
The program should be able to:
- Read user commands from the console;
- Display a saved list of tasks from the file;
- Add new entries to the list and save them to the file.
The program validates the proper date format and correct "is important: true/false" parameter;
- Remove entries from the list and update the file accordingly.
Program informs the user when the last task has been deleted and doesn't allow to remove a task, when the list is empty.
